# Todoey âœ“

## My Goal

The objective of this project was to understand how to manage state in Flutter. While working on Todoey, I looked at various Flutter architecture choices and learned to use the officially recommended Provider package to manage my app state.

## What I have created

A todolist app to keep track of all my tasks.

## What I have learned

- Understand what is state and why we need to manage it.
- Understand the difference between ephemeral (local) state and app state.
- See the problems with simply relying on setState().
- Learn about the concept of Prop Drilling.
- Examine various popular ways of managing app state for Flutter projects.
- Learn about the List Builder.
- Use the Flutter BottomSheet Widget.
- Learn to lift state up to be able to access it from children widgets.
- Learn about design patterns and why they are useful.
- Understand how the Provider package works and use it to manage app state.

## Next Steps

Integrate Firebase with this app so that it will have a backend database.
